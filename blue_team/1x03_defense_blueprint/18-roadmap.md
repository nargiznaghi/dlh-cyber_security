**Completed:**

* core VLANs operational
* Westside firewall installed
* guest access isolated
* EHR access restricted

## Milestone 3 — November 30, 2026: Detection and Recovery Operational

**Completed:**

* EDR deployed
* Wazuh collecting critical logs
* alerts assigned
* offsite backups replicating

**Success Indicator:** At least 95% of endpoints report to EDR, four critical log sources report to Wazuh and backup replication completes successfully.

## Milestone 4 — January 31, 2027: Strategy Validated

**Completed:**

* recovery test completed
* ransomware exercise performed
* vulnerabilities rescanned
* Risk Register updated
* Board report delivered

**Success Indicator:** All High and Critical risks have an owner, treatment decision and current residual-risk rating.

# Risks to the Timeline

## Risk 1 — Clinical Systems Cannot Be Interrupted

Hospital systems and medical devices may have limited maintenance windows, delaying patching or segmentation.

**Contingency Plan:** Schedule changes during low-activity periods, test changes in stages and maintain a rollback plan. Prioritize internet-facing and high-risk systems when all systems cannot be changed together.

## Risk 2 — Limited IT and Security Staff

The IT Director, Security Analyst and Deputy CISO may not have enough time to complete all activities while supporting daily operations.

**Contingency Plan:** Use vendor implementation support for EDR and firewall deployment, assign clear weekly priorities and defer lower-risk administrative tasks rather than delaying MFA, segmentation, monitoring or backups.
