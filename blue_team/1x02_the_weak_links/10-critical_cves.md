* **Asset Role:** Billing application and financial-data server
* **Asset Criticality:** Confidentiality: High, Integrity: High, Availability: High

### Technical Analysis
* **Vulnerability Description:** Apache `mod_lua` can suffer a buffer overflow from a crafted remote request, possibly allowing unauthenticated code execution.
* **CVSS Base Score:** 9.8 — Critical
* **Exploit Availability:** 3/5 — Public PoC exists, but reliable code execution needs more work
* **CISA KEV Status:** Not listed
* **CWE:** CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)

### Contextual Analysis
* **Network Exposure:** Reachable through port 80 from the flat internal network.
* **Kill Chain Position:** Initial access and execution on the billing server.
* **Threat Actor:** Ransomware group using vulnerable public or internal services.
* **Related Findings:** Combines with Finding 002 for root privilege escalation, Finding 006 for MySQL exposure and Finding 011 for unsupported Ubuntu.
* **Adjusted Priority:** Critical
* **Justification:** It is remotely exploitable without authentication, affects a critical server and can start a complete compromise chain.

## 2. Finding 003

* **Finding:** 003
* **CVE:** N/A — Misconfiguration
* **Host:** `ehr-db-01` — `10.10.2.11`
* **Asset Role:** Stores patient records and protected health information
* **Asset Criticality:** Confidentiality: Critical, Integrity: Critical, Availability: High

### Technical Analysis
* **Vulnerability Description:** PostgreSQL accepts connections from every system in `10.10.0.0/16` instead of only the EHR application server.
* **CVSS Base Score:** N/A
* **Exploit Availability:** N/A — No exploit is required
* **CISA KEV Status:** N/A
* **CWE:** N/A — Configuration weakness

### Contextual Analysis
* **Network Exposure:** Reachable from any compromised host on the flat internal network.
* **Kill Chain Position:** Credential access, collection and patient-data theft after initial compromise.
* **Threat Actor:** Ransomware group or malicious insider.
* **Related Findings:** Combines with Finding 031, which may expose EHR database credentials.
* **Adjusted Priority:** Critical
* **Justification:** An attacker who compromises any internal device could directly target the patient database. No CVE exploit is needed.

## 3. Finding 004

* **Finding:** 004
* **CVE:** CVE-2017-0144 and other unpatched CVEs
* **Host:** `WS-RAD-01` — `10.10.1.70`
* **Asset Role:** MRI scanner control workstation
* **Asset Criticality:** Confidentiality: High, Integrity: Critical, Availability: Critical

### Technical Analysis
* **Vulnerability Description:** The workstation runs unsupported Windows XP and exposes vulnerable SMB and RDP services.
* **CVSS Base Score:** CVE-2017-0144: 8.1 — High
* **Exploit Availability:** 5/5 — Weaponized EternalBlue exploit
* **CISA KEV Status:** Listed
* **CWE:** CWE-119 (Memory Buffer Weakness)

### Contextual Analysis
* **Network Exposure:** Reachable from the workstation subnet with no VLAN isolation.
* **Kill Chain Position:** Execution, lateral movement and disruption of clinical equipment.
* **Threat Actor:** Ransomware group using SMB exploitation.
* **Related Findings:** Flat-network exposure increases the effect of Findings 007, 018 and 019.
* **Adjusted Priority:** Critical
* **Justification:** The device controls an MRI system, cannot receive normal patches and is vulnerable to mature ransomware-related exploits. NVD records active exploitation of CVE-2017-0144.

## 4. Finding 007

* **Finding:** 007
* **CVE:** N/A — Misconfiguration
* **Host:** `ad-dc-01` — `10.10.2.20`
* **Asset Role:** Primary Active Directory domain controller
* **Asset Criticality:** Confidentiality: Critical, Integrity: Critical, Availability: Critical

### Technical Analysis
* **Vulnerability Description:** LDAP signing is not required and SMBv1 is enabled, allowing relay attacks and exposing an unsafe legacy protocol.
* **CVSS Base Score:** N/A
* **Exploit Availability:** N/A — Standard attack tools can abuse the configuration
* **CISA KEV Status:** N/A
* **CWE:** N/A — Configuration weakness

### Contextual Analysis
* **Network Exposure:** Reachable from all hosts on the flat internal network.
* **Kill Chain Position:** Credential access, privilege escalation and domain takeover.
* **Threat Actor:** Ransomware group or advanced external attacker using credential relay.
* **Related Findings:** Combines with weak Kerberos encryption in Finding 018 and DNS information exposure in Finding 025.
* **Adjusted Priority:** Critical
* **Justification:** Active Directory controls identities and access across MedDefense. Compromise could provide control over almost every connected system.

## 5. Finding 031

* **Finding:** 031
* **CVE:** CVE-2020-1938
* **Host:** `ehr-srv-01` — `10.10.2.10`
* **Asset Role:** Main EHR application server
* **Asset Criticality:** Confidentiality: Critical, Integrity: Critical, Availability: Critical

### Technical Analysis
* **Vulnerability Description:** The exposed Tomcat AJP connector allows an unauthenticated attacker to read application files, including files that may contain database credentials.
* **CVSS Base Score:** 9.8 — Critical
* **Exploit Availability:** 5/5 — Working PoCs and a Metasploit module exist
* **CISA KEV Status:** Listed
* **CWE:** NVD-CWE-Other

### Contextual Analysis
* **Network Exposure:** Port 8009 is reachable from compromised hosts on the flat network.
* **Kill Chain Position:** Credential access and collection after initial internal compromise.
* **Threat Actor:** Ransomware group seeking EHR credentials and patient data.
* **Related Findings:** Combines directly with Finding 003 because stolen credentials could be used against the exposed PostgreSQL database.
* **Adjusted Priority:** Critical
* **Justification:** The vulnerability affects the EHR server, has automated exploitation and can expose credentials leading directly to patient data. NVD records active and automatable exploitation for CVE-2020-1938.
